# *D*ont *G*amble *W*ith *R*isk

A monte carlo simulation system for complex quantitative risk modeling of risks, costs, and benefits. Based loosely on the [FAIR](https://www.fairinstitute.org/) model and [montecargo](https://github.com/bcdannyboy/montecargo)

## Example Outputs

Example probability outputs for the scenario described in main.go are found in `probabilities.json` and the impact values are found in `impacts.json`. These are the results of running the simulation 100,000 times.
